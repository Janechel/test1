## 1. Preliminary Notes
- In the memory table, some parameters use the value ranges for high bytes and low bytes, with addresses as **the lower byte first and the higher byte next**. Negative values are expressed as the complement of the original code.
- Instruction Packet: If before the change of the data in the Flash area **Flash switch is not turned on, it will not be saved when the power is turned off.**
- Status Packet: Different servos may respond with different information in different states.
    - If there are no errors during the servo instruction packet's processing, the status packet's status value will be 0x00.
    - If a specific error occurs, the corresponding bit is set to 1, and a status packet without parameters is returned.
    - When multiple errors occur simultaneously, the corresponding Bit bits are all set to 1, that is,**values are added together**.

*Take the primary memory table as an example.*
- Instruction Packet: Use ID1, write data 0x02 starting from the servo ID 0x07 in the memory table.
- Status Packet: Since the servo ID has been changed to 2, no status packet will be returned. Sending Ping instruction to the servo ID2 can be used to verify if the change was successful.


#### Change the servo ID of the servo with an unknown ID to 1. 
*Take the primary memory table as an example.*
- Instruction Packet: Use roadcast ID, write data 0x01 starting from the servo ID 0x07 in the memory table.
- Status Packet: Since broadcast ID (0xFE) is used to send instructions, no status packet will be returned.  Sending Ping instruction to the servo ID1 can be used to verify if the change was successful.


#### Change the baud rate of servo ID1 to 9600. 
*Take the primary memory table as an example.*
- Instruction Packet: Use ID1, write data 0x01 starting from the return delay time 0x08 in the memory table (9600 corresponds to number 1).

- Status Packet: Since the return level has been changed to only respond to the Ping instruction, no status packet will be returned. Sending the read data instruction can be used to verify if the change was successful. If there is no response to the read data instruction, it indicates that the change was successful.


#### Change the angle limit of servo ID1 to 100°~150°. 
*Take the primary memory table as an example.*
- Instruction Packet: Use ID1, sequentially write data 0xE8 0x03 0xDC 0x05 (1000, 1500) starting from the min angle limit 0x0B in the memory table.
- Status Packet: Reading the angle limit of the servo can be used to verify if the change was successful.
    - Note: The servo position limits have been changed, and the target position (including the velocity base target position and time base target position) will be forcibly set within the range of position limits. If it exceeds the set max angle limit or lowers the set min angle limit, the angle alarm bit (Bit: 0x02) in the servo's present status will be set to 1. If the LED condition has the angle alarm enabled, the servo will cycle the LED switch between 1 and 0, causing the LED light to flash; if the shutdown condition is enabled for angle protection, the servo will set the torque switch to 0, thus disabling the torque. 


#### Change the max temperature limit of servo ID1 to 65℃. 
*Take the primary memory table as an example.*
- Note: The max temperature limit has been changed. When the present internal temperature of the servo exceed the upper limit, the temperature alarm bit (Bit: 0x04) in the servo's present status will be set to 1. If the LED condition has overheat alarm enabled (default is enabled), the servo will cycle the LED switch between 1 and 0, causing the LED light to flash. If the shutdown condition has overheat protection enabled (default is enabled), the servo will set the torque switch to 0. That is, disabling the torque.


#### Change the voltage limit of servo ID1 to 3.5~8.4V. 
*Take the primary memory table as an example.*
- Note: The voltage limit has been changed. When the present input voltage of the servo exceeds the set max voltage limit or lower than the set min voltage limit, the voltage alarm bit (Bit: 0x01) in the servo's present status will be set to 1. If the LED condition has voltage alarm enabled, the servo will cycle the LED switch between 1 and 0, causing the LED light to flash. If the shutdown condition has voltage protection enabled, the servo will set the torque switch to 0. That is, disabling the torque.


#### Change the max PWM limit of servo ID1 to 90%. 
*Take the primary memory table as an example.*
- Note: The high level time accounts for 90% of the entire cycle, but the servo outputs a PWM of less than 100%. Reducing the PWM output of the servo will decrease its torque and velocity.


#### Change the max current limit of servo ID1 to 900mA. 
*Take the primary memory table as an example.*
- Note: The max current limit has been changed. When the servo's present current exceeds the set current limit and the duration is longer than the specified current protection time, the stall alarm bit (Bit: 0x20) for the servo's present status will be set to 1. If the LED condition has stall alarm enabled (default is enabled), the servo will cycle the LED switch between 1 and 0, causing the LED to flash. If the shutdown condition has stall protection enabled (default is enabled), the servo will set the torque switch to 0, thus disabling the torque.


#### Change the current shutdown time of servo ID1 to 500ms. 
*Take the primary memory table as an example.*
- Note: The current shutdown time has been changed. When the servo's current exceeds the set current limit and the duration is longer than the specified current protection time, the stall alarm bit (Bit: 0x20) for the servo's present status will be set to 1. If the LED condition has stall alarm enabled, the servo will cycle the LED switch between 1 and 0, causing the LED to flash. If the shutdown condition has stall protection enabled, the servo will set the torque switch to 0, thus disabling the torque.

- Note: When the servo is within 0.2° clockwise of the target position, the motor will not output any torque.


#### Change the PWM punch of servo ID1 to 20%. 
*Take the primary memory table as an example.*
- Note: The PWM Punch is factory-set based on the motor characteristics and is generally used to compensate for the servo's control deadband of the servo or overcome static friction.
    - Note: It can be observed that increasing the single PWM overlay value causes the motor's velocity to decrease, accompanied by jitter.


#### Change the position control P gain of servo ID1 to 5500. 
*Take the primary memory table as an example.*
- Note: The PID parameters can influence each other, and excessive adjustments may lead to new problems, so adjustments should be made with caution.
- Status Packet: It can be observed that increasing the single P value makes the control system more sensitive to errors and faster in response, but if set too high, it may cause overshoot and oscillation.


#### Change the position control D gain of servo ID1 to 100. 
*Take the primary memory table as an example.*
- Note: The PID parameters can influence each other, and excessive adjustments may lead to new problems, so adjustments should be made with caution.
- Status Packet: It can be observed that increasing the single I value reduces the system's steady-state error, making the system more precise; however, if it is too large, it may lead to system instability.


#### Change the position control D gain of servo ID1 to 250. 
*Take the primary memory table as an example.*
- Note: The PID parameters can influence each other, and excessive adjustments may lead to new problems, so adjustments should be made with caution.
- Status Packet: It can be observed that increasing the single D value suppresses excessive response speed and oscillation, making the system smoother; however, if it is too large, it may lead to jitter and instability.


#### Change the control mode of servo ID1 to the time base position control mode. 
*Take the primary memory table as an example.*
- Note: Before switching the servo ID1 control mode, please power on the servo ID1 again or turn off the torque switch. In the same control mode, you only need to set the control mode once to set different movements for the servo.

#### Change the Flash switch of servo ID1 to ON. 
*Take the primary memory table as an example.*
- Instruction Packet: Use ID1 to write data 0x01 starting from the Flash switch address 0x2E in the memory table.
- Status Packet: Reading the Flash switch status of the servo can be used to verify if the change was successful.


#### Change the LED switch of servo ID1 to ON. 
*Take the primary memory table as an example.*
- Note: When operating the torque switch, the current status flag bits of the servo will be cleared. For example, when an overcurrent condition triggers stall protection, the servo torque will be disabled, and writing a value to the plan position will not elicit a response from the servo.
- Warning: If the servo needs to be forcibly working again by operating the torque switch to clear the stall protection flag bits, there is a certain risk. Please ensure that appropriate protections are in place (such as reducing the load) before performing this operation.


#### Change the target PWM of servo ID1 to -50%. 
*Take the primary memory table as an example.*

#### Change the target current of servo ID1 to -100mA. 
*Take the primary memory table as an example.*
- Note: When using the current control mode to move the servo, it is essential to ensure that the control mode is set to 2 and that the torque switch is turned on.
- Status Packet: Reading the target current of the servo or observing if the servo rotates counterclockwise with a target current of 100mA can be used to verify if the change was successful.
- Additional Note: In position control mode (including time base position control and velocity base position control), the target current is used to limit the servo's maximum output current. A smaller current results in less locking force for the servo, and at this point, the target current has no positive or negative values. Setting this value too high may cause slipping, while setting it too low may lead to overshooting.


#### Change the velocity base target position of servo ID1 to 150°. 
*Take the primary memory table as an example.*
- Note: When using velocity base position control mode to move the servo, it is essential to ensure that the control mode is set to 1. When writing values to the target position address, the torque switch will automatically be set to 1, enabling the torque.
- Instruction Packet: Use ID1 to write data 0xDC, 0x05 sequentially starting from the velocity base target position address 0x35 in the memory table.
- Status Packet: Reading the velocity base target position of the servo or observing if the servo moves to the midpoint can be used to verify if the change was successful.
    - Note: When the present position is the same as the target position, the servo will not move.


#### Change the time base target position and moving time of servo ID1 to 300°, 500ms respectively. 
*Take the primary memory table as an example.*
- Note: When using time base position control mode to move the servo, it is essential to ensure that the control mode is set to 0. When writing values to the target position address, the torque switch will automatically be set to 1, enabling the torque.
- Instruction Packet: Use ID1 to write data 0x... sequentially starting from the time base target position address 0x3C ... in the memory table.
- Status Packet: Reading the time base target position and moving time of the servo or observing if the servo moves to the 300° position in 500ms can be used to verify if the change was successful.
    - Note: When the present position is the same as the target position, the servo will not move.

### 2.4 Sync Write
#### Change the velocity base target position of the servo ID1, ID2 to 150° midpoint and 0° position, respectively. 
*Take the primary memory table as an example.*
- Note: When using velocity base position control mode to move the servo, it is essential to ensure that the control mode is set to 1. When writing values to the target position address, the torque switch will automatically be set to 1, enabling the torque.
- Instruction Packet: Use the broadcast ID to synchronously write 2 bytes starting from the velocity base target position address 0x35 in the memory table. For ID1, write data 0xDC, 0x05; for ID2, write data 0x00, 0x00.
- Status Packet: Since the instruction is sent using the broadcast ID (0xFE), no status packet will be returned. Reading the velocity base target position of each servo or observing whether each servo moves to the corresponding position can be used to verify if the change was successful.
    - Note: When the present position is the same as the target position, the servo will not move.


#### Change the time base target position and moving time of servo ID1, ID2 to 150° midpoint, 1s, and 500ms respectively. 
*Take the primary memory table as an example.*

- Status Packet: Since the instruction is sent using the broadcast ID (0xFE), no status packet will be returned. Reading the time base target position of each servo or observing whether each servo moves to the corresponding position within the set time can be used to verify if the change was successful.
    - Note: When the present position is the same as the target position, the servo will not move.


#### Intermediate/advanced memory tables: under continuous development, explained in the future

#### Calibrate the midpoint of the servo.
- Warning: Generally, calibration is done at the factory condition. If this function is not operated according to the specified steps or is performed multiple times consecutively, it may result in excessive deviation of the servo's target position, causing it to enter the dead band and operate abnormally. Please use it with caution. If this situation occurs, it can be fixed by performing a Factory Reset Instruction.
- Note: There is a scale line at the 150° position on the horn. When aligned with the scale line on the outer shell, it is the 150° middle position.
- Instruction Packet: Use ID1 to send the calibration instruction, with parameters 0xDF 0xDF to unlock this function.

### 3.4 Current Control Mode
#### Let the servo ID1 rotate clockwise with a target current of 100mA. 
*Take the primary memory table as an example.*

**Operation Steps:**
1. Write "0" to the torque switch, turning off the torque.
2. Write "2" to set the control mode, switching to the current control mode.
3. Write "1" to the torque switch, enabling the torque.
4. Set the target current, allowing servo ID1 to move as specified.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Change the torque switch of servo ID1 to OFF.
2. Change the control mode of servo ID1 to the current control mode.
3. Change the target PWM of servo ID1 to 100mA.
4. Change the torque switch of servo ID1 to ON.
